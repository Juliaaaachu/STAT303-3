# STAT303-3


As per Github's limitations on uploading large files, we have refrained from pushing the data to the repository. Instead, you can refer to the original data source at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/overview to access the actual data. For this project, we have utilized the application_train.csv file as our training dataset.
